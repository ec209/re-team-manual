# Reliability Engineering on-call escalation

This page is intended to provide information to people on the RE on-call
escalations rota.

## What is the RE on-call escalation rota?

Each of the teams in Reliability Engineering operate an on-call rota to provide
out-of-hours cover for the various services RE supports. This is a mix of
primary support for things RE is responsible for, such as the PaaS and Alert
Manager, and backup for on-call engineers in other service teams.

To support this we also maintain an on-call escalation rota of RE leadership
folks to serve the following purposes:

* To act as an automatic escalation if an on-call engineer fails to respond to
an incident. If this happens the escalation person is responsible for finding
someone from the team who can respond to the incident.
* To provide leadership-level backup for RE on-call engineers if an incident
requires leadership decision making or a broader response involving updating
comms or activating other engineers.

The on-call escalation is __not__ expected to actually fix issues or provide
technical expertise. Rather, the escalation is there to provide leadership-level
backup, decision making and co-ordination of serious incidents.

## Where can I find the RE escalations rota?

The RE escalations rota and the person currently on-call for escalations [can be
seen via the RE escalations rota in
PagerDuty](https://governmentdigitalservice.pagerduty.com/schedules#P02OIA8) or
via the [rotas

### GOV.UK

GOV.UK incidents are managed using [the GOV.UK Incident
Process](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/incident-management-guidance.html).
The Incident Lead and Comms Leads will always be GOV.UK people, except for long
running infrastructure incidents where the Incident Lead might switch to a
member of the RE GOV.UK team, but comms will always be handled by GOV.UK so the
RE escalation person will never need to do this.
